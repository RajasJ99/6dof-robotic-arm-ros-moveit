# 6dof-robotic-arm-ros-moveit

Original code [https://github.com/bandasaikrishna/6-DOF\_Manipulator](https://github.com/bandasaikrishna/6-DOF_Manipulator)

I modified for my own robot. To use for robot with less Dof use IKfast.

To implement compile using catkin\_make and run the real\_robot.launch

To implement on your own robot , you need to modify the urdf and rebuild the config using the setup assistant and then add the real robot file in the folder.

For checking the urdf use the website [https://mymodelrobot.appspot.com](https://mymodelrobot.appspot.com/)
